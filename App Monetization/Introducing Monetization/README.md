# KPIs

## Example
Here is a KPI example: "Gain 10% new paying customers every month"

Let's break down the above KPI to clearly define what is a metric, what is the KPI, what is the goal this KPI is driving. Let's work backwards and think of our goal first:

## Goal: Gain 1000 paying customers by June, 2016
This goal tells us that we want to have 1000 paying customers by June, 2016. The more paying customers we have means that we are driving revenue. Notice how we add in a time to complete this goal. We are binding this goal to a time to ensure that we stay accountable and not waste time to growing 1000 customers by June, 2016. Goals need to be time-bound.

How will we measure progress up to June, 2016? We need a metric that can help us measure the number of paying customers in any given month.

## Metric: Percent of Paying Customers for any given month
This is the actual value that we can objectively measure. We will use this metric in order to create our KPI.

## KPI: Grow 10% new Paying Customers every month
In order to grow our paying customer base to 1000 by June, 2016, we want to see how well we are growing paying customer base every month. This KPI tells us that we want to grow our customer base by 10% every month. We assume that we have enough total users that can convert to 1000 paying customers by June, 2016.

Therefore the KPI is a <strong>measurement of progress or a milestone</strong> that we can constantly check every month to ensure that we are going in the right direction to achieve our goal of attaining 1000 paying customers by June, 2016.
